 * app fee is applied — the swap still works, it just isn't monetised.
 *
 * Paycrest off/on-ramp fees are configured separately (senderFeePercent) in
 * the Paycrest Sender Dashboard, not here.
 *
 * NOTE: NEXT_PUBLIC_* is read via literal access so Next.js inlines it for the
 * client bundle (the Relay widget path). A fee recipient is a public address,
 * so exposing it in the bundle is fine.
